Description: US EPA has designed a rapid and automated in vitro screening platform using the TempO-seq targeted RNA-seq assay to profile chemical bioactivity across a range of concentrations and cell types. The scale and complexity of these data (measurements of ~20,000 genes across thousands of samples) has necessitated the development of a bioinformatics pipeline to ensure standardized and reproducible results across these screening efforts.  This package includes R and Python code for rapid and robust processing of TempO-seq data, leveraging existing open-source tools wherever possible (e.g. HISAT2, samtools, DESeq2).  This pipeline also includes a battery of QC metrics developed specifically for TempO-seq data generated in large-scale automated experiments, and additional functions to store and access multiple levels of analysis results in an intuitive NoSQL database (MongoDB).  The package is intended for both internal EPA/ORD use and to allow external researchers to reproduce our results, process their own data, and ultimately facilitate the development of community standards for high-throughput transcriptomic analysis in a regulatory context.
